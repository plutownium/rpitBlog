            <h1>Reasons Software Dev Sucks</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The big lie about software dev is that it's such an in demand skill, companies will be pounding down your door to hire you if you're skilled. It isn't true.</p>
            <p>The reality is that you'll have to grind seven days a week, all of your evenings, all of your weekends, for about two years to be even close to job ready.</p>
            <p>Employers will expect you to know frontend web dev, backend web dev, and dev ops (the act of deploying the program to a server) just to let you in the front door. As of Fall 2022, there's an added on requirement of a CS degree. Anyone who gets hired without one now has extraordinary luck.</p>
            <p>Once you do gain these skills, you'll have to send out three hundred resumes a week. This application phase will last between three months and twelve months. I've heard of software devs who haven't been able to get a job within a full year. I wager the majority of the wannabe devs who put the work in and can't get hired aren't too hot on talking about their failure. Why would they want to? But suppose you do get in the door.</p>
            <p>In any other profession worth a damn, the employer will train you. Plumbers train you. Doctors train you. Lawyers train you. Cashiers, baristas, waiters, bus drivers, engineers, physicists, biologists, paramedics and police all receive training. Not so in software dev.</p>
            <p>Head over to Indeed.ca if you're Canadian or Indeed.com if you're American. Type in "javascript" and search country wide. In Canada, you'll see about two thousand two hundred results for JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Now type in the following query: "javascript title:junior". The "title" modifier limits the search to positions for junior developers, which is the entry level role. As of this writing, Canada has 35 Junior Developer roles open nationwide. These 35 jobs will be fought over by all ten or twenty thousand computer science graduates looking for a job.</p>
            <p>This isn't the behavior of an industry trying to fix its shortage of talent.</p>
            <p>Another reason software dev is a terrible skill is that no one can tell you what an impressive software dev project looks like. Software projects come in three flavors: The bland and unimpressive portfolio project. The impressive artificial intelligence. And the kind you need an entire team of people to develop. There is no answer for helping a non-technical recruiter or manager identify you as talented.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence is its own field, and the talent there (so I hear) does indeed have people beating down the door to work with you. But it requires a bachelors degree in mathematics and statistics, and possibly a masters as well. The only people I know who can work in that field have an IQ of at least 125, on average.</p>
            <p>I only know a few impressive software dev projects that can be handled solo. But these impressive projects consume about six months of full time labor to build, and then no one cares about them anyways. Why? Because recruiters are too ignorant to distinguish between a program that is an extraordinary feat of programming and a bland and run of the mill application. It isn't a good deal.</p>
            <p>My third reason software dev sucks is that the skill limits you to working with software. Contrast that with medicine, which enables you to work with people. People. All eight billion of them. Or accounting. Everyone pays taxes at some point. They can't get enough plumbers, and all people and all businesses have running water and toilets. A sales rep can sell anything. A marketer can sell anything. But a software dev is limited to working with software.</p>
            <p>Your long four year journey into learning software doesn't work out. You can't get a job. What do you do with the skill? It's worthless. You can't make money as a freelance software developer unless you can sell, but then you should have been a sales rep. You can't sell access to an app you built yourself unless you're a skilled marketer, but then you should have been a marketer. It's a worthless pursuit if you aren't getting paid for it.</p>
            <p>Worse, the time you spent learning to code was likely in the thousands of hours. There are 2,080 hours in a full year of forty hour work weeks. Two years of full time labor, at minimum wage, is worth $36,000. So learning to code costs, in terms of opportunity cost, about $36,000. And there's no knowing in advance whether you'll be good at it or not. Odds are (and ask any software dev to confirm) you won't be good at software dev. So the choice to learn, you could describe as risky.</p>
            <p>If I could go back in time and warn myself to do something other than learn to code I'd do it in a heartbeat. The mistake is even worse because I was already both interested in and good at both persuasion and writing by the time I decided to learn to code. Read it again: I was already interested in selling. I was already good at persuasion. I was already a writer. Thus, the right decision was to go where I was strong. Coding wasn't it.</p>
            <p>If I ever hear someone ask whether software dev is a good path to follow, I'll tell them no.</p>
