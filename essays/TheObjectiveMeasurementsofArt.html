That it cannot be objectively measured. However, that is a myth! And I can prove it to you here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h4 class="c8" id="h.k4w34ekpxcto"><span class="c10">&ldquo;First they ignore you...&rdquo;</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two objective measurements of art are as follows:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">1. Do people pay attention to the art?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">2. Does the artist or an entity (perhaps a corporation) earn money from the existence of the art?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Here I introduce a concept that was first invented by E.E. Cummings in his 1927 Vanity Fair article, &ldquo;The Agony of the Artist (with a capital A).&rdquo; In summary, an Artist with a Capital A is someone who agonizes over his art. Suffers through it. Cummings sets up a contrast with a Commercial Artist, which he describes as an artist with a &ldquo;little a.&rdquo; This is someone whose art exists to sell and be seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Now, I assert that in fact it is the Little A Artist whose art has objective success. Indeed I can and will measure the success in terms of value, and we will see that commercial artists are the real winners in the art game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We&rsquo;ll describe an emotional response to art as having some amount of value. We&rsquo;ll call that [abstract?] quantity measured in the unit E, short for &ldquo;emotions.&rdquo; We could also call it F for feelings, but E will do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We&rsquo;ll also describe the experience of perceiving art as having some amount of value. We&rsquo;ll call the value experienced during the perception of a piece of art measurable by the unit P, short for perception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then we&rsquo;ll describe the experience initiated at the point where a person realizes they desire to pay for a piece of art, and ends when the sale is concluded, as having a unit we describe as S, as in &ldquo;a sale.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Finally, I&rsquo;ll assert that value, in any way shape or form, has value valued by the unit V. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Now, we know that all artists make stuff. There isn&rsquo;t any kind of artist whose art only exists in his head. (Or in her head.) There is performance art, which doesn&rsquo;t exist except in the transient time where the artist is performing the art. We can count that as art regardless of how rare it is to see a performance artist. But in summary, we all agree that an artist who tells you &ldquo;My thoughts are my art&rdquo; is a strange and wild kind of artist that we don&rsquo;t need to consider at all. Indeed they could be a writer, but only if they actually write their thoughts down on paper. I conclude this absurd paragraph here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anyway, all artists make stuff. And the people I&rsquo;m disagreeing with go now, &ldquo;Ohhhhh, it&rsquo;s all subjective!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ohhhhh, we can&rsquo;t say whether an artist&rsquo;s work is objectively good or not!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ohhhh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But in fact that&rsquo;s some dumb bullshit and I&rsquo;ll show you why:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.74yxwur0nwhm"><span class="c3">Story A: Bethany&rsquo;s Tale</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bethany is a great artist who creates art she doesn&rsquo;t show anybody but herself and sometimes her mom. Bethany is 28 and cherishes her own art. She values it highly because, practices as she is, she &ldquo;nails it&rdquo; every time. Good for Bethany! She has been practising her craft since the age of 8 and has a long and passionate history of pursuing art. So when she&rsquo;s hit with her periodic yet irregular flood of inspiration, she&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Ohhhhh, here I go. Another masterpiece.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And indeed her works are masterpieces to herself. She nails it. If she was an archer, she would be the kind of archer who hits dead center 9 times out of 10, and never fully misses the target. Meaning, what she intends to say, in her art, she always says. She never says something else accidentally. That&rsquo;s masterful in its own way, and if you don&rsquo;t understand how masterful that is, you&rsquo;ve never set out to write a short story about one thing and ended up writing a short story about something else. That really happened to me! (I was 17.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">So Bethany gets struck by inspiration, goes to town, and just demolishes that empty space. She really gets in there. She creates. And when she&rsquo;s done, the empty canvas (perhaps she is really a painter) is full of beauty. Chock full of it. Her happy accidents have taken on a life of their own: Her story she wanted to tell has ups and downs, a first act and a third, a prologue people are enthralled by and an epilogue the reader wishes would never end. When the book (her painting) is over, in the words of the actor Terry O&rsquo;Quinn, the audience goes, &ldquo;You close the book and say, &lsquo;That was great!&rsquo;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">So Bethany is a great artist, but...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She only shows her art to herself, and her mom! This will be important later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.359sph8v4u5v"><span class="c3">Story B: About Desmond Hume</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Desmond Hume is a great artist who creates art he shows to his agent, and then to his publisher, which his publisher then (usually) shows the editor, who in turn closes the loop by showing the publisher (again), who in turn shows the distributors, who in turn shows the world. Desmond Hume goes on to show podcast hosts and radio hosts, goes on to show his Instagram account and TikTok account and Twitter account&rsquo;s&rsquo; followers. Millions of people see Hume&rsquo;s art.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then, thousands of people buy Hume&rsquo;s art in the first month it is for sale. Wow! He goes to #1 in the Amazon bestsellers list.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then, over the span of a decade, a million more people buy Hume&rsquo;s art. Wow! He goes on to be a multimillionaire several times over from the sales of one singular book!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Desmond Hume, secretly, endures great agony creating every book. He micromanages peoples&rsquo; perception of the book. He surveys the market. He asks his friends and family and strangers and market research groups what kind of problems they have. What kind of desires they have. What their dreams are. What keeps them up at night. What makes them tick, yawn, sprout an erection, regret the decisions they made last night, enjoy food, enjoy movies, enjoy working out. He asks them why they do stuff. He really gets to know people, and, as a result, he&rsquo;s astute at inventing new ideas for new books.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then he writes, writes, writes, writes, writes some more, and then for a change of pace, writes slowly. He does it fast. He does it in the car. While he&rsquo;s getting ready for bed. While he&rsquo;s on vacation (but a working vacation). He edits, rewrites, then edits some more! And finally, he&rsquo;s done yet another masterpiece.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Desmond Hume is a well known and nigh famous artist. It&rsquo;s normal for people to know who he is. He learned his craft apprenticing under the famous writer Robert Greene, and has had a long and successful career at this point. He is sixteen years into being a repetitive bestseller, which is longer than a lot of people have even been alive. He knows what he&rsquo;s doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anyway, Desmond Hume&rsquo;s books sell like hotcakes every time! For about two years while he&rsquo;s steadily promoting the books. Hume makes a great bundle of cash off of selling these books, and then, when he&rsquo;s done, he says directly to the metaphorical representation of the book, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in another life, brother!&rdquo;, forgets about the book and prepares to write yet another bestseller. Cake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This will all become relevant later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.kk2lzd4vfwy1"><span class="c3">Story C: The Story of Leonard George</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Leonard George is a great artist who creates art he shows to approximately 4,827,000 people per month via his Twitter, Instagram and TikTok accounts. He knows because he counts the views in his analytics reports. George knows he is doing well at art because he receives strong indicators that he is very much &ldquo;over the target&rdquo; when he creates his art. Though people do not pay him much for the art he creates, he does get paid. And though he isn&rsquo;t a well known artist the way Desmond Hume is, the air around him fills up with the terrifying explosions of exploding flak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I am using a war metaphor: They say &quot;You know you&rsquo;re over the target when you start catching flak&quot; because, in World War II, the Allied forces knew they were flying over a target worth bombing because the Germans would start shooting at them. Bombing was new back then: No one really knew what a building looked like from 3 kilometers up in the air, so they had to kind of guess at what they were bombing. They didn&rsquo;t know how to aim their bombs either, so again, they had to kind of guess at whether they were actually going to hit stuff. But the Germans gave themselves away over and over, by firing at the bombers. So the terrifying awareness of drawing fire from anti-aircraft guns was simultaneously good news: The Allied bombers were over something worth bombing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">How does this relate to art? Well, posting your art for others to see it is fucking scary. Attention, indeed, is a mixed bag: Some good, some bad. You can&rsquo;t produce objectively good art without selling it or people seeing it, hence my thesis: Good art is what sells and is seen. But anyway, putting your art on display is terrifying! So if art is a war, the distressing experience of receiving attention in response to your art is much like being shot at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Similarly, putting your art up for sale is scary! What if no one buys it? What if people pay too much for your art and have Buyer&rsquo;s Remorse? That sucks and is suffering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anyway, George posts his art online via Instagram. He has video jockeys remix it and post it on TikTok. He posts it on Twitter. Slowly but surely, Dash is building a career as a well known, commercially successful artist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Here we have a sharp turn into an explanation of the three stories.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.p1b3z7ur6qr8"><span class="c12">Explanation</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Story A contains a story about an artist who only shows her art to herself and her mother. Recall our described units of value: Bethany&rsquo;s art creates, on average, 400 * E units of value. Bethany&rsquo;s art, over the course of a year, creates, on average, 4,000 * E units of value, because she finishes 10 pieces of art a year. Thus 10 years of Bethany&rsquo;s labors produce 40,000 units of E.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stories B and C contain stories about artists who sell their art or have art that is perceived by millions of people. Hume&rsquo;s character creates art worth, on average, 4,000,000 * S units of value. And he pulls it off every two years! Thus, over 10 years, Hume creates 5 * 4,000,000 * S units of value via his art. That is 20,000,000 units of S over 10 years! In Story C, we read about George. George&rsquo;s character creates art seen, on average, 4,827,000 times per month! That&rsquo;s 57,924,000 times per year! Wow! So Dash&rsquo;s art creates 57,924,000 * P units of value per year!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Here the &ldquo;Art is subjective!&rdquo; crowd encounter some bad news: We can mathematically compare the value of Bethany&rsquo;s art to that of Hume&rsquo;s and George&rsquo;s. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh no&rdquo; they say. Yeah. Bad news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suppose we ask Bethany to put a monetary value on 58 * E units of value. Bethany says, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trade my art for the world!&rdquo; and then, after the negotiator presses her to put up a number, she coughs up &ldquo;$4,000&rdquo; for one singular repetition of creating one of her masterpieces. Now we have $4,000 = 58 * E. Therefore 1 E is worth $68.96. (Check my math: $4,000 / 58 = 68.9655)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suppose we ask that new artist Leonard George to assign a monetary value to the audience&rsquo;s response to HIS art. He tells us, &ldquo;Like, dude, I&rsquo;m getting paid for it already. I don&rsquo;t need to do that. I pay rent with my art and have done so for three years.&rdquo; So the negotiator presses him a bit and he coughs up, &ldquo;Um, like, $6,000 for a month of views. Because, the views help me make the sales, and the sales pay my rent.&rdquo; So we now have that $6,000 is equal in value to 4,827,000 * P units of value!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, hang on, I need to catch my breath from laughing,&rdquo; says my critic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h4 class="c8" id="h.g55k55tblpgd"><span class="c10">&ldquo;Then they laugh at you...&rdquo;</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To keep everything in terms of years and make the math more bearable, we&rsquo;ll say that Leonard George&rsquo;s work yields him 4,827,000 * 12 * P units of value per year. Desmond Hume&rsquo;s work yields 1,000,000 * S units of value per year (because his 2m * S valued payloads arrive every two years). Bethany&rsquo;s only yields 4,000 * E.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The bad news for the &ldquo;Art is subjective!&rdquo; crowd now continues: We&rsquo;re going to express the P units and S units produced by George and Hume in terms of E. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Let&rsquo;s say that a person must experience 43 units of E to convince themselves that it&rsquo;s worth buying art. (You apparently don&rsquo;t need to feel as much to convert you into a sale as you would feel about art you yourself produced.) We&rsquo;ll further say that a person experiences, on average, 13 units of E when they perceive a piece of art. &nbsp;These are both gross simplifications that hide a cacophony of complexity, but they&rsquo;ll do for now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">(For reference, Bethany gains 58 units of E per piece, while a person experiences 43 units of E to convince them to fork over $25 or whatever for one of Hume&rsquo;s books. And Hume&rsquo;s work produces </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We can now convert the units of S and units of P into units of E.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.218jh9e1umd8"><span class="c12">Sales Into Emotions, S Into E</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Desmond Hume&rsquo;s 20,000,000 units of S from publishing 5 bestsellers over 10 years may be expressed as 20m S / 43 E * 43 S / E. Thus the 20m units of S are now 465,116.13 units of E! Thus, the people reached by Desmond Hume&rsquo;s bestsellers experienced 11.627 times as much E as Bethany&rsquo;s artwork, and we didn&rsquo;t even factor in them enjoying the work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Indeed I am measuring directly how much emotional response was generated by the artwork of fictional Leonard George and fictional Desmond Hume against the fictional Bethany. But in fact, I have made an objective claim about the objective measure of art.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You can cook up different numbers if you want to, but Fate has shown her hand: At a minimum, we&rsquo;ve expressed an objective comparison between Bethany&rsquo;s artwork and that of Hume&rsquo;s work. And Hume, were we to factor in his fans enjoying his work, is far, far ahead. (Please note: I bet a REAL version of Hume would produce 10,000,000x as much value as that of Bethany, but I didn&rsquo;t cook the numbers right.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Now we consider Leonard George&rsquo;s transmutation from view count into emotions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h2 class="c6" id="h.3cl7obri0gqa"><span class="c12">Perception Into Emotion, P Into E</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I said Leonard George is racking up &ldquo;4,827,000 * 12 * P units of value per year&rdquo; by pushing his artwork into peoples&rsquo; feeds on social media. I said something like &ldquo;1 unit of P is equal to 13 units of E, because every time someone sees a piece of artwork, they experience on average 13 units of E.&rdquo; So now we can express 4.8 million impressions per month, a year at a time, in terms of E. Let&rsquo;s do that:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">4,827,000 * 12 * P = 57,924,000 units of P.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">13 E per P = 57,924,000 * 13 * E = 753,012,000 units of E</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And now the &ldquo;Art is subjective!&rdquo; crowd goes &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Turns out dearest Mr George is cranking out like 753x Bethany&rsquo;s output per year using social media to push his art into peoples&rsquo; faces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c13">Boooooooooooooooooooom!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The artist who shows his work to people takes the cake!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">753,000,000 is 18825.3x as much value as Bethany will put out in her entire life as an artist!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Thus, the VALUE of the art that is shown to an audience far exceeds that of art that is shown to no one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The VALUE of the art that is sold to an audience far exceeds that of art that is sold to no one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Look at this guy!

But you aren&rsquo;t free to be right, because I am right and you, if you disagree, are wrong about art being a purely subjective experience. You remain free to have a subjective experience, but you are forever barred from stating that it cannot be measured in an objective manner. Because I just did that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The opposition be like: &lt;screeches in cognitive dissonance&gt; &ldquo;You moron!!!!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><h4 class="c8" id="h.excpnddz6lw7"><span class="c10">&ldquo;...And then you win.&rdquo; - Mahatma Ghandi, allegedly.</span></h4><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And so I say to the &ldquo;Art is subjective!&rdquo; crowd: </span><span class="c11">Suck it dorks, I beat you.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Phone me up and deliver your verbal submission.

But we can certainly measure the value of an emotional response, measure the value of communicating something complex via image, audio, scent, taste or text. Likewise, we can measure the monetary value of art, and we can measure how much attention it receives. There is no arguing about this. Thus, I&rsquo;ve proved that art has objective measurements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Fin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Thanks for reading! &#x1f642;</span></p></body></html>
