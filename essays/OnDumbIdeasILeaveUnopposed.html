But I say nothing because grown men cry up a storm over critical commentary. The harmful idea then runs UNOPPOSED as fanboys endorse the presenter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What am I to do about that? Ignore the stupid idea? Let other people pay a premium price to find out, via real life experience, that the idea was pure, unadulterated garbage the moment it left the drafts?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ideas are thoughts. Thoughts become speech. Speech becomes thoughts in other peoples&rsquo; minds. Thoughts become actions, and actions have consequences. Thus, ideas have consequences, and I mean all of them. Perhaps useless, uninteresting ideas, such as &ldquo;foo enters Saturn, surrounded by bar, becoming baz. Quux!&rdquo; are harmless, and this one was harmless because it&rsquo;s nonsense. Meaningless. But the particular set of ideas that I see on Twitter, and am subjecting to critical analysis in this piece, aren&rsquo;t nonsense, aren&rsquo;t meaningless, and don&rsquo;t die on the page the way my ideas do. Indeed, these ideas travel, and ideas that travel are precisely the kind that have consequences.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let me spell it out for you:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dozens upon dozens of accounts broadcast tweet length ideas that, when interpreted by a wise man or a genius, probably turn out fine for 99 of 100 of them. But, for a dumb person, or a fool, these ideas reap awful harms upon them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here is one such malevolent meme that I&rsquo;ve found on Twitter a thousand thousand times since 2015:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If your friends aren&rsquo;t keeping up with you, and they drag you down with a bad influence, you should cut them off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I mean yeah, the 43 year old woman who still sleeps with drug dealers? &ldquo;I wish you the best! Best of luck to you and good fortune! Farewell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The friend you&rsquo;ve had for a decade who still sells drugs on the side, and offers you the opportunity to buy? &ldquo;It was nice to know you! You&rsquo;ll do well for yourself I&rsquo;m sure. Adios!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The best man from your wedding who you met railing lines of cocaine in a bathroom with your then-girlfriend 20 years ago? Who STILL doesn&rsquo;t have a net worth upwards of seven figures?! Ah, he has to go! What a loser!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The great friend you&rsquo;ve been speaking with regularly for eight months confesses she used to be a drug dealer eight years ago. &ldquo;Oh. Well we all grow up. No one has time for cocaine anymore!&rdquo; you reply. And she says to you, &ldquo;Haha, yeah, I just use it to get work done now.&rdquo; BOOM, GHOSTED. See ya!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And there it is: You see the problem!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Where do we draw the line?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whose judgement do we use to set the threshold for cut, not cut? In and out? Friend, former friend, stranger?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is a grey area where a dumb person, a fool, a non-critical thinker, can be lead astray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So what happens when they see the idea, spread across Twitter like frosting on a cake, over and over, by guru after guru, by trusted advisor after trusted advisor?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s talk numbers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A million people see the idea. 1 * 10^7. Ten percent act on it! 1 * 10 ^ 6. Eighty percent of those interpret it right, and use exceptional judgement: They cut the dead weight, shield themselves from bad influences, raise their standards for acceptable social behavior. Excellent! 0.8 * 10^6, four hundred thousand people, stop talking to Howard, the creepy older friend who hits on their wife when they&rsquo;re alone &ndash; or the equivalent. Success! Four hundred thousand women block the beautiful but violent alcoholic, Alexander, from messaging them yet another time on Facebook! Stupendous!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s 80% of 1,000,000 people. Eighty percent get a good result.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now what about the remaining 20% of the one million observers of the idea?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How many times do these unfathomable morons and fools act on the advice? Maybe a million times over ten years!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They end relationship after relationship after relationship. Ghost friend after friend after friend. Tell a great old friend they&rsquo;ve had since childhood they&rsquo;re cut off, cut off! Because of a social misstep around their girlfriend. The girlfriend asks them later, &ldquo;Why cut him off?! You&rsquo;ve known him since elementary school!&rdquo; and the fool replies, &ldquo;Because he told you are such a great batter at baseball! He was hitting on you!&rdquo; And the girlfriend goes silent!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(Later, she explains to her mom that she had confided in the friend that she was insecure about her athleticism since the end of childhood &ndash; but, she says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no way to explain that now!&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I doubt that my example is good, but you get the idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So like, sorry, but the advice isn&rsquo;t good in sentence form. It just isn&rsquo;t good. It should not be said. Or if it is said, the person giving the advice ought to reply and say, &ldquo;yes indeed, you make a good point: There are lots of people in the grey areas who are worthy of keeping.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I say: Have you heard of the expert named Lindy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy asks: How much effort does it take to replace a friend you&rsquo;ve had for six years?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And someone in the crowd shouts: Six years!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy looks amused. He smiles, tilts his head. Raises a finger up and pushes his hand forward gently, silencing crowd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: But suppose your friendship started when you were twenty-eight. What age are you at the end of the six years? You are thirty-four! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pausing, Lindy waits for the crowd to show, via their silence, that they do not get the point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy continues: You have less time to replace a six year old relationship at the end of the six years! Your life is closer to its end. Were you a time traveler, you could travel back in time to the age that you met that friend you just sent sailing away into the unknown. Now please, may I hear from the crowd again?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A middle age woman in the crowd speaks up. She says aloud, &ldquo;But, Mister Lindy, I&rsquo;m much better at making friends now that I am in my forties! I&rsquo;ve done a lot of work on myself &ndash; I used to be a shut-in bookworm! I&rsquo;m more outgoing, and more open about myself. I go to a social meeting every weekend! I have lots of friends now! So, I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Lindy replies: Yes, ma&rsquo;am. You are better at making friends now that you&rsquo;ve grown up more. But, may I ask? How many of those new relationships are older than ten years?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And, she goes, &ldquo;Well, none of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And Lindy says: What would it take for any of those relationships to be as old as the friendships you&rsquo;ve had since childhood? Say, what age did you meet your oldest, most ancient friend?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And she goes, &ldquo;We met when I was three. By now, I&rsquo;ve known her forty-six years. But, I don&rsquo;t understand again &ndash; whatever is your point?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy replies: &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, for one of your new friends to be your friend longer than that friend you&rsquo;ve had since childhood, you would have to know them an additional forty years! On average. And, by that time, the friend you&rsquo;ve known since childhood &ndash; supposing you stay her friend &ndash; would have known you... eighty-six years?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He pauses again for effect... and continues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: So you see, the friends you&rsquo;ve had a decade are not as easy to replace as you might think. Their value isn&rsquo;t equivalent to a friendship you start today and keep for a full decade! Because, by that point, that friend you&rsquo;ve already had for a decade could be starting decade three of friendship! Now now, do we have a mathematician in the audience?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An old man speaks up. He wears a green hat, has a worn shirt, and sits next to his wife, two of his kids, and two of his grandkids.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The old man: I am a mathematician!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: What is the value of six plus six?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The old man: Twelve!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: What is the value of six times six?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The old man: Thirty six!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: And now, sir, what is the value of six to the power of six?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The old man: Well, give me a moment. I need a calculator. &lt;A pause while he shuffles through his coat.&gt; Mister Lindy, the value of six to the power of six is forty-six thousand, six hundred and fifty six! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">[Editor&rsquo;s note: 6^6 = 46,656]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, I proclaim to you that the value of a friend does not increase linearly over time, as with addition. Nor does it scale via multiplication, as with the number six times six. Indeed, the value of a friend scales more according to the power law. When you raise a number to a power, even two small numbers, like six and six, become enormous values! Thus, a friendship grows in value according to the power law &ndash; or more closely to the power law than to anything linear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And someone in the crowd speaks up:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anonymous: Sir, but sir, what is the cost of being friends with an old friend who drags your life down? What is the cost of remaining friends with a bad influence?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: Yes, this is a great point. If you value the wrong person too highly, the expected outcome of your life &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t get better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anonymous, again, almost interrupting: So what, sir, should we do about old friends with questionable judgement?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: Ah, I wonder if you could help me answer. What would your grandmother have told you to do about a friend like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anonymous: Well, sir, I cannot say! I do not know what my grandmother would tell me to do here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: Pretend you do know!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anonymous: Okay! Given that she often told me to avoid the bad kids in the first place, she might tell me to part ways with the friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: Good! But what would she say about a friend you&rsquo;ve had for ages, who has gone astray?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The unidentified man pauses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anonymous: She might say I should let him go. She might say, maybe in a few years, he&rsquo;ll be much better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: Go on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">[Editor&rsquo;s note: I did not, in fact, ask any grandmothers what to do here. I am making stuff up because I don&rsquo;t know what, specifically, to say. But I do know that the answer is to seek wisdom, and not go charging off following questionable advice.]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anonymous: I think she once said that, a friendship that was ever real, likely doesn&rsquo;t erode over time. I think her exact words were, &ldquo;If a friendship was ever real, a decade apart would not tame its sails.&rdquo; So, maybe, if I just, become distant with the friend, their bad influence wouldn&rsquo;t affect me! Or at least, that&rsquo;s what I think she would say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: Wonderful! And who was your grandmother?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anonymous: Her name was Kate, sir! She was a spy in the war. We moved here after the peace treaty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lindy: Cherished. And so, ladies and gentlemen, we uncover what to do about a friend who has gone astray! Indeed it is alright to let them go. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And, now, a man raises his hand. Says his name is Desdel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Desdel: Hi, Mister Lindy, I wonder what to do about the friends who appear to be in a grey area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here, the scene ends abruptly, because, in truth, it is difficult to say what to do about the people in the grey area. And yet we recognize that, visually speaking, the grey area is not thin. Maybe it&rsquo;s thin if your judgement is good! True. But how wise are you, really? Are you free of mistakes of judgement in this domain? Consider: The idea &ldquo;cut off bad influences from your life before they drag you down&rdquo; is a novel thought to many people! Indeed, they haven&rsquo;t thought of that since highschool. Yes, to many people, the idea &ldquo;ghost people who openly disrespect you in front of your spouse&rdquo; is old news. So is &ldquo;avoid befriending drug addicts, and distance yourself as best you can from the ones you didn&rsquo;t know you were friends with.&rdquo; Yet, I say again: The grey area both exists, and is not thin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So what do you do about that? What about the people who are too dumb to recognise what is and isn&rsquo;t in the non-grey area? Suppose there are overly cautious idiots in the crowd of millions who see these ideas exchanged on Twitter. What about them? Should they be able to see the counter-argument and save themselves from cutting off an exceptional friend for a minor flaw?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Do you see the point?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here, I conclude! For I am tired, and I have to finish somehow. Because it&rsquo;s 11:27 pm, and I have to go to sleep!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In short, I have no idea what to do about this issue. Do I ignore the thoughts? Probably! Personal responsibility and individualism demands ignoring stuff I cannot change. I have more pressing problems to attend to, and I can&rsquo;t save the world by myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thus, I desist, and thank you for reading.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Adieu.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
