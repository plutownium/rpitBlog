They will only work if you don&rsquo;t already have hearing loss. If it&rsquo;s too late, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it: You&rsquo;ll go away from it with regrets.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.j1frfih2dg78"><span class="c3">Exercise #1 </span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As you&rsquo;re going to bed, leave an inch wide opening in your window. Lay in bed. Listen to the neighborhood&rsquo;s faintest sounds. Notice that you can hear distant sounds. What is the furthest sound you can hear? If you&rsquo;re under 18, chances are you can hear stuff that happens a long ways away, because sound travels.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You&rsquo;ll be able to hear cars passing by a full block away. The sounds of young people walking around at night. The quiet ambience of a hundred distant sounds blending together into a gentle hum. Though the lack of sound, the silence, implies non-movement, the ambient volume of those distant sound sources blending together will imply life: You will know that you are still around people, still connected to your neighborhood, to your city. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The nighttime sounds are a romance of sorts. A story that tells you that you are in the thick of a thousand stories you&rsquo;ll never know. Each passing human sound will hint at someone living a life you are connected to only by the faintest logic, yet connected to nonetheless. Each rise and fall of the volume of the ambience will share a distant story like a secret whispered by a stranger.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This exercise will show you a form of beauty that you will wave goodbye to as your hearing degrades from exposure to loud music. The erosion of your hearing will happen over years, not weeks, and thus you&rsquo;ll be unable to recognize the damage. You&rsquo;ll tell yourself that it is okay to continue eroding your hearing until it is too late: Too bad, can&rsquo;t hear the quiet anymore.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The point of the exercise is to recognize the beauty of the quiet, to stop taking the quiet for granted. For quiet is its own music. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.e44bnq5vyz11"><span class="c3">Exercise #2</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Odds are that you live in the city, because most people live in the city. But you can travel to a nearby spot of nature in less than two hours, so this exercise requires traveling to a nearby forest, desert, or mountain range. A lake would do nicely. So would an *empty* beach (a crowded one won&rsquo;t work because of people talking) on a day when there are no waves.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This exercise demands sitting quietly in your chosen patch of forest or desert, on the top of a mountain (away from people), on the shore of a lake or the ocean. Whichever you choose, choose somewhere that is silent, or seems that way while your hearing is adjusted to the sound of you walking. Note that walking itself is quiet, and yet the threshold of your perception of sound will have to adjust for you to hear the truly quiet sounds of nature. You also need to choose a day when the wind is stagnant, because even gentle wind is louder than the most quiet of quiet sounds.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, once you&rsquo;re in your chosen spot of nature, find somewhere to sit and sit there for twenty minutes. The ideal location is near but not close to a river, so its movement is perceptible if you deliberately focus on the sound.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While you&rsquo;re sitting, pay attention to the quietest of quiet sounds that you can barely hear against the backdrop of silence.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Can you hear a distant bird calling? The distant step of some animal? Perhaps you observe a loon dip into the lake a hundred feet away: Can you hear the distant &ldquo;sploosh&rdquo; as it enters the water? If you chose a mountain or a desert, what does the gentle movements of air tell you about the place you&rsquo;re visiting? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shift your feet on the ground. Can you hear the sound of your feet moving?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there is a nearby river, can you hear the river? What do you know about the state of the river?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there are distant birds, how quiet are the birds?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Final question: Do you experience beauty while doing this? Would you like to permanently stop yourself from experiencing the beauty?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.b7wuso5ofw7"><span class="c3">What&rsquo;s It Worth To You?</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Recognize that damaging your hearing means saying goodbye to the above scenes of auditory beauty in a permanent way. The ringing in your ears caused by hearing damage is a mistake you cannot undo. There is no surgery, no pharmaceutical aid, that will undo the ringing. Once you gain the ringing in your ears, the songs silence sings will never be heard again. Instead, you will hear the ringing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t think going to a nightclub ten times a year is going to cause this issue, and indeed it would be fine if that was all it was: Ten times a year for a period of about five years, for a total of fifty visits. The issue is that even five visits a year, psychologically, puts you close to thirty visits a year, which is a waste of time all on its own. But worse, the thirty visits a year, or even ten visits a year, will add up to hearing damage.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Going to music events and nightlife establishments is short term fun. You have a good time for like four hours.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cost is that, for the rest of your life, you have a little bit more difficulty perceiving quiet.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I remember thinking about the costs to my hearing, way back when. I did calculations every few months: &ldquo;If I go out again, how much worse will my hearing be the next day?&rdquo; The answer was always, &ldquo;Too little to notice, so I&rsquo;m going out.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The issue is that the hearing loss happens gradually, too slow to be perceived. If you were able to A/B test the damage to your hearing, across two years, by flipping a switch, you would notice the damage. It would be obvious. &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t hear quiet as well as I used to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.ojssc0ejxnzw"><span class="c3">Young People Are The Dumbest Demographic, and Some Math</span></h2><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Young people consistently choose loud music venues, and repeat exposure to them, over a far higher probability that they will have great hearing, and no tinnitus, later on in life. People also make the twin decision, which is to pump the volume on their headphones or speaker system while at home, in the car, or at the gym. Both these activities guarantee some level of tinnitus.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Indeed, I&rsquo;m not saying that the right amount of exposure to hearing damage is zero. I&rsquo;ll say it again: Zero is the wrong amount! But as we go from 1 unit of exposure, to 2 units of exposure to 3 units of exposure, 1 unit of exposure yields K units of benefit. Does 2 units of exposure then yield K * 2 units of hedonistic goodness? No, it&rsquo;s more like K * 1.98 units. And then 3 units of exposure doesn&rsquo;t yield K * 3 units. It&rsquo;s more like K * 1.94 units of benefit, K * 1.94 units of hedonistic goodness. I am saying that there is a decreasing marginal utility (this is an economics term) of exposure to loud music, meaning that as your exposure increases, the typical gain you get from exposure decreases disproportionately.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I also wanted to ask the reader to contemplate the likelihood that they&rsquo;ll want to be able to perceive quiet later on in life. If the reader is a young person they might flippantly say that they&rsquo;d prefer to &ldquo;make the most&rdquo; of being young and choose the nightclubs, music festival circuit and blaring headphones over being able to quietly, peacefully enjoy the silence of a library at age 63. Indeed, you might not even make it to 63! Doesn&rsquo;t wisdom say to take advantage of youth while you have it?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It does not.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wisdom is recognizing that even if you don&rsquo;t care about future you right now, future you will be stuck dealing with the consequences of younger you&rsquo;s decisions for a long time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two hundred nights of fun (and sometimes the night out sucks!) spread out over eight years...</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At a cost of 40 to 80 years of hearing an omnipresent &ldquo;EeeeeeeeeEEEEeeeEEeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrereeeeereeeeeeeeeee&rdquo; for the rest of your life.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is this a good trade? I think not.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Young people who are certain, dead certain their future self will be OK with trading permanent ringing in their ears &ndash; audible over even lots of medium volume sounds, like the sound of rain &ndash; for &ldquo;memories&rdquo; and a handful of great short lived experiences, are wrong. There is some kind of saying: You can&rsquo;t convince a stupid person that they are stupid, because they are stupid. (I bet Ed Latimore said it.) There is seriously viable math to describe how dumb it is:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let&rsquo;s assign the fun of going out to a nightclub for 4 hours to be 1,000 units of pleasantness. We&rsquo;ll disregard the complexity added by factoring in that sometimes going out to a nightclub sucks ass. We&rsquo;ll also disregard the cost of being so drunk you feel sick, the cost of feeling guilty about neglecting all the better uses of your time, and the cost of recognizing that you spent too much time on hedonism last month and fell behind in your studies. Keep it simple. 2 visits to a nightclub a month, 12 months in a year, 1,000 Pleasantness Units per visit. 2 * 12 * 1,000 = 24,000. Cool.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now let&rsquo;s look into the unpleasant costs of hearing ringing in your ears for 40 years. We&rsquo;ll suppose the reader dies around age 65, which is pretty normal. Suppose the unpleasant ringing is noticed once a month, ten times over the span of 20 minutes, for approximately 8 seconds each before fading back out of awareness for like half a minute. Let&rsquo;s assign the unpleasantness an estimated 3 Unpleasantness Units per entrance into awareness. (Yes, just 3.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3 * the 10 times its noticed * 1x/mo * 12 mo/year = 30 * 12 = 360 Unpleasantness Units per year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">360/year * 40 years = 14,400 units of unpleasantness.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Note that the previous two paragraphs are unedited. I chose small numbers on purpose. Now I&rsquo;ll choose some bigger numbers...!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suppose the unpleasant ringing has a cost of 90 Unpleasantness Units and is noticed 10 times per span, at the same 1x/month rate, for 40 years. 90 is 30x the previous value of 3.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">14,400 * 30 = 432,000</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, I can&rsquo;t do this math for you, and indeed your numbers will look different for you.

You might be someone who has extraordinary social skills and thus gets a huge kick out of exercising them at a nightclub. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, you also ought to consider that life is considerably more pleasant when you&rsquo;ve stacked up dozens of permanent (or well maintained non-permanent) changes. It&rsquo;s easier to tolerate the natural ebbs and flows of life, the continuous and indifferent suffering of the universe, when Former You did Future You a lot of favors. The other side of the same coin: When you&rsquo;ve built up a dozen injuries with permanent downsides, slacked on education, slacked on building WiFi Money, haven&rsquo;t ate a great diet, haven&rsquo;t gone to the gym regularly (ever), life can be perilous.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do you make something good out of so many permanent downsides?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And hearing damage is a permanent downside.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thus, what is the cost of the ringing?

And as an infant, this child will rest in a crib. If you&rsquo;ve evaded a ringing in your ears until then, you&rsquo;ll be able to hear your child moving in his crib: The rubbing of his or her clothing against the cloth of the crib&rsquo;s blankets might even be audible to you.

But only if you haven&rsquo;t damaged your hearing too badly to hear those low decibel sounds.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I leave you with the thought that hearing loss doesn&rsquo;t sound like silence or even quiet. It sounds like ringing; permanent ringing. The ringing is with you from the time you wake up, to the time you&rsquo;re in the office (where mine is far beyond audible over the quiet of my laptop), to the time your head hits the pillow at night.
